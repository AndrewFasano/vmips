User-visible changes in version 1.0.1 (since version 1.0):

* Fixed format-string bug in vmipstool.
* Fixed "extra tokens after #endif" warning in sample_code/asm_regnames.h.
 
User-visible changes in version 1.0 (since version 0.9):

* A standard clock device has been added.
* The "vmipstool" front end to compilation tools was added, and most of
  the random scripts lying around have been consolidated into it.
* The memory-mapped test device known as "TestDev" has been removed.
* Debian and Red Hat packaging files have been added.
* The installation procedure has been greatly improved.
* The VMIPS manual has been completed.
* Many, many bugs fixed as a result of a concerted attempt at testing
  everything.  Doubtless, some bugs still remain.
* Some portability fixes.
* Dumping of the stack (when registers are dumped) now works.
* Many strange messages the debugger backend used to print out have been
  quelled. Also, killing the debugger connection should no longer cause
  a crash.
* vmips now supports --help, --version and --print-config command-line
  options.
* The SPIM-compatible console device now works better when the host
  machine is byte-swapped with respect to the MIPS target.

User-visible changes in version 0.9 (since version 20001014):

* vmips.debug is no longer built.
* Read-only memory is now really read-only.  This allowed us to add
  debugger support for breakpoints in ROM.
* Debugger support for exception handling -- CPU exceptions are now
  delivered to your GDB, if it is attached, giving you a chance to poke
  around before the target is made aware of the condition.
* Many tasty configury updates, making it easier to build.
* Miscellaneous bugs fixed in many places.
* Branch on coprocessor 0 instructions now have defined behavior.
* Many places which erroneously had text after #endif in the source have
  been corrected to use comments instead, allowing you to compile vmips
  with newer C++ compilers.
* Some old test code that used to run at the beginning of every vmips
  job has been removed, so you will no longer see the familiar messages
  it printed out.

User-visible changes since version 20000517:

* Emulating a little-endian MIPS on a big-endian host passes preliminary
  tests.  Build process queries MIPS tools for their endianness
  automatically.  Builds tested on Solaris SPARC, i386 Linux, FreeBSD
  and HP-UX.  Distribution building (gmake distcheck) almost works.

User-visible changes since version 19991114:

* Polling input and output via the SPIM-compatible console device now work.

User-visible changes since version 19990829:

* Build processes seeks out MIPS tools; Installation documentation now
  briefly documents how to build cross tools. 

User-visible changes since version 19990823:

* Spim console documentation completed; first attempt at spim console code.

User-visible changes since version 19990801:

* Documentation Makefile.in has been built.
* Some documentation has been updated.
* VMIPS is being adapted to use GNU Autoconf and Automake.
