   VMIPS 1.1.2 has been released. VMIPS is a MIPS R3000 virtual machine
simulator with support for a serial console and GNU cross-compiler tools.

reporting instructions, please see the VMIPS Manual.

   User-visible changes in version 1.1.2 (since version 1.1.1):

* An instruction that turns on interrupts in the system control coprocessor
  (coprocessor 0) will no longer immediately take an exception if an interrupt
  is pending; now it will happen at least one instruction later.
* When building VMIPS in debug mode, the coprocessor 0 Cause register may no
  longer contain random, non-clearable interrupt-pending bits.
* The coprocessor 0 Cause register's interrupt-pending and coprocessor-error
  bits are now correctly updated when an exception is taken.
* The VMIPS physical-memory manager will now allow you to place two devices
  directly adjacent to one another in memory; it used to complain that they
  overlapped, when they actually did not.
* A typo was fixed in the testsuite documentation.

   To get the code from CVS as any bug fixes are added, checkout from branch
"vmips-1_1-branch". VMIPS 1.1.2 itself can be checked out using the tag
"release-1-1-2".

   Please refer to the bug reporting instructions in the VMIPS manual
if you have trouble using the software.
