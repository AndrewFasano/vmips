   VMIPS 1.4 has been released. VMIPS is a MIPS R3000 virtual machine
simulator with support for a serial console and GNU cross-compiler tools.
This release incorporates a few features, a few bug fixes and a few
code cleanups.

   You can download VMIPS 1.4 from any of the following sites:

* ftp://ftp.dgate.org/vmips/releases/vmips-1.4/
* http://download.sourceforge.net/vmips/

   VMIPS is free software available under the GNU General Public
License; for details, please read the file "COPYING". For installation
instructions, please read "INSTALL". VMIPS was built by Brian Gaeke and
others; for details, please see the files "AUTHORS" and "THANKS". New

"NEWS".

   The home page for VMIPS is "http://www.dgate.org/vmips". For bug
reporting instructions, please see the VMIPS Manual.

   User-visible changes in version 1.4 (since version 1.3.2):

   * A new interaction facility was implemented. This allows you to
     suspend the simulation, print registers and memory, and then
     continue by running or single-stepping, without needing to use a
     full-fledged debugger.

   * Some of the memory-mapped I/O devices have had endianness bugs
     fixed and debugging printouts removed.

   * Certain coprocessor zero branch instructions no longer
     unnecessarily cause reserved instruction exceptions.

   * Other minor optimizations.

   To get the code from CVS as any bug fixes are added, checkout from branch
"vmips-1_4-branch". VMIPS 1.4 itself can be checked out using the tag
"release-1-4".

   Please refer to the bug reporting instructions in the VMIPS manual
if you have trouble using the software.
