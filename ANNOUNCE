  User-visible changes in version 1.0.2 (since version 1.0.1):

* New default handling of `-o ttydev' option; manual updated.
* /etc/vmipsrc contains only comments by default.
  These two fixes work around a bug in Darwin select(2)'s tty handling.
* Only print host processor endianness if `-o bootmsg' is set.
  Fixes bug where `-o bootmsg' should (but doesn't) turn this message off.
* Remove test_code/testdev.S from the branch.
  This is a test for a feature (TestDev) which wasn't distributed with 1.0.x.
* Comment out extra tokens after #endif in test_code/{sort.c,tester.c}.
  Fixes bug where gcc 3.0 gives warnings compiling these files.

   To get the code from CVS as any bug fixes are added, checkout from branch
"vmips-1_0-branch". VMIPS 1.0.2 itself can be checked out using the tag
"release-1-0-2".
