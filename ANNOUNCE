   User-visible changes in version 1.0.4 (since version 1.0.3):

* Fixed bug where the first instruction of an interrupt handler would be
  executed twice in a row. Thanks to Paul Twohey.
* Workaround some problems in the way casts are used in VMIPS by specifying
  -fno-strict-aliasing to gcc in configure; this should help avoid
  miscompilations for now, until the code can be rewritten for cast-safety.
* Fix bug where vmips would dereference a NULL pointer when trying to use a
  SPIMConsole device with a non-attached serial host. Thanks to Paul Twohey.
* Reorder some tests in the SPIMConsole code for a slight speedup when
  interrupts are turned off.
* Fix bug where virtual page numbers were being incorrectly interpreted
  by the system control coprocessor, resulting in excess TLB misses being
  generated. Thanks to Sanjeev Datla.

   To get the code from CVS as any bug fixes are added, checkout from branch
"vmips-1_0-branch". VMIPS 1.0.4 itself can be checked out using the tag
