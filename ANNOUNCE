   The home page for VMIPS is "https://github.com/Hordeking/vmips". For bug
reporting instructions, please see the VMIPS Manual.

   User-visible changes in version 1.0 (since version 0.9):

* A standard clock device has been added.
* The "vmipstool" front end to compilation tools was added, and most of
  the random scripts lying around have been consolidated into it.
* The memory-mapped test device known as "TestDev" has been removed.
* Debian and Red Hat packaging files have been added.
* The installation procedure has been greatly improved.
* The VMIPS manual has been completed.
* Many, many bugs fixed as a result of a concerted attempt at testing
  everything.  Doubtless, some bugs still remain.
* Some portability fixes.
* Dumping of the stack (when registers are dumped) now works.
* Many strange messages the debugger backend used to print out have been
  quelled. Also, killing the debugger connection should no longer cause
  a crash.
* vmips now supports --help, --version and --print-config command-line
  options.
* The SPIM-compatible console device now works better when the host
  machine is byte-swapped with respect to the MIPS target.

   We have also branched for bug fix releases (vmips-1.0.x).  To get
the code from CVS as any bug fixes are added, checkout from branch
"vmips-1_0-branch".

   Please refer to the bug reporting instructions in the VMIPS manual
if you have trouble using the software.
