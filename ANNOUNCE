   VMIPS 1.3.1 has been released. VMIPS is a MIPS R3000 virtual machine
simulator with support for a serial console and GNU cross-compiler tools.
This release primarily focuses on minor bug fixes and portability
improvements.

reporting instructions, please see the VMIPS Manual.

   User-visible changes in version 1.3.1 (since version 1.3):

   * VMIPS now compiles and passes most of its regression tests under
     Microsoft Windows using Cygwin. There is one known failure
     (misc-tests/echo), but the failure stems from the testsuite, not
     VMIPS; I suspect that my old version of Expect is at fault.

   * The build status report script, `buildstat.sh', has been removed
     from the distribution.  (Since it was broken in version 1.3 and no
     one complained, we're assuming that no one will miss it much!)

   * Two bugs in the testsuite that could have led to spurious test
     failures have been fixed.

   To get the code from CVS as any bug fixes are added, checkout from branch
"vmips-1_3-branch". VMIPS 1.3.1 itself can be checked out using the tag
"release-1-3-1".

   Please refer to the bug reporting instructions in the VMIPS manual
if you have trouble using the software.
