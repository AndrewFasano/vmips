   User-visible changes in version 1.1.1 (since version 1.1):

* A bug involving shifts by 0 or 32 bits (e.g., using instructions like srlv)
  producing incorrect results has been fixed.
* The absence of an FPU attached to coprocessor slot 1 can now be
  detected by user programs.
* The system control coprocessor (coprocessor 0) now returns the correct ID
  number for the R3000A processor in the PRId register.
* Emulation of store-byte and store-halfword operations for emulated devices
  that only support store-word should now work correctly on byte-swapped
  configurations.
* A bug in vmipstool which caused it to fail to find alternate linker scripts
  (supplied with the --ld-script option) has been fixed.
* A gcc warning caused by a (harmless) comment in asm_regnames.h has
  been quashed.
* A bug where little-endian vmips configurations would dump core when
  the disassembler was used (e.g., when the instdump option was turned on)
  has been fixed.
* `configure' no longer ignores its --with-mips-include option.

   To get the code from CVS as any bug fixes are added, checkout from branch
"vmips-1_1-branch". VMIPS 1.1.1 itself can be checked out using the tag
