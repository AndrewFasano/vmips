   User-visible changes in version 1.2.1 (since version 1.2):

   * Fixed a bug where delay slot execution could be triggered even when
     emulating a malformed jr (jump-register) instruction.

   * Fixed a bug where, upon taking a TLB Miss exception, the ASID of
     the page that could not be looked up would be overwritten (in the
     CP0 EntryHi register) with garbage.

   * Fixed a bug in VMIPS configurations with multiple interrupt
     devices, where Interrupt Pending bits of the CP0 Cause from
     previous interrupts could be left asserted even if the device that
     asserted them had subsequently deasserted them.

   * Fixed a bug where the memory dump file and ROM file would be opened
     in text mode. They are now opened in binary mode.

   To get the code from CVS as any bug fixes are added, checkout from branch
"vmips-1_2-branch". VMIPS 1.2.1 itself can be checked out using the tag
