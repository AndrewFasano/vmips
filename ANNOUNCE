   VMIPS 1.1 has been released. VMIPS is a MIPS R3000 virtual machine
simulator with support for a serial console and GNU cross-compiler tools.
This is a release with significant enhancements over the VMIPS 1.0 series.

   VMIPS is free software available under the GNU General Public
License; for details, please read the file "COPYING". For installation

reporting instructions, please see the VMIPS Manual.

   User-visible changes in version 1.1 (since version 1.0.4):

* If you are using g++ to compile VMIPS, you must use g++ version 2.95
  or later. Also, you must specify the --target option to `configure',
  with an argument that matches the --target option to binutils
  `configure'. See `INSTALL'.
* VMIPS now supports GNU standard --help and --version options.
* The manual now includes improved documentation for using gdb and
  Insight to control VMIPS, a section on the differences between SPIM's
  console and the SPIM-compatible console device, a section on proper
  error reporting from VMIPS extensions, and many other minor
  revisions.
* Using gdb to control VMIPS is now much more robust in the face of
  errors and exceptions.
* VMIPS 1.1 makes it possible to use the 2nd display/keyboard channel
  of the SPIM-compatible console device, using the `ttydev2' option.
* VMIPS now includes a halt device, which can be used to halt the
  simulator without using a special instruction.
* VMIPS 1.1 is much faster than VMIPS 1.0.4. This is due in large part
  to the efforts of Paul Twohey, who reimplemented the clock and
  SPIM-compatible console devices, and cleaned up the code a bit.
* The VMIPS distribution now includes a regression test suite, based on
  DejaGNU (replaces the old test_code directory). In order to support
  this, the formats of lots of random messages that VMIPS prints out
  have changed.
* We now support 64-bit hosts (e.g., Alpha). 

   To get the code from CVS as any bug fixes are added, checkout from branch
"vmips-1_1-branch". VMIPS 1.1 itself can be checked out using the tag
"release-1-1".

   Please refer to the bug reporting instructions in the VMIPS manual
if you have trouble using the software.
