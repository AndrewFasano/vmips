   User-visible changes in version 1.2.2 (since version 1.2.1):

   * A bug in the Makefiles and configure scripts has been fixed, where
     some files would not be installed if you didn't configure with
     cross compilation tools (using `--with-mips').

   * Vladimir Machulsky found and fixed a bug in the debugger interface,
     where the register file would be sent to gdb incorrectly. Thanks!

   * VMIPS will no longer abort and dump core when bad command-line
     arguments are passed to it.  Instead, it will print an error
     message and exit with a non-zero exit code.

   * A bug in the command-line option processor was fixed, where using a
     completely empty `~/.vmipsrc' or the `-F /dev/null' option could
     cause the options parser to parse garbage, usually resulting in
     harmless, but annoying error messages.

   To get the code from CVS as any bug fixes are added, checkout from branch
"vmips-1_2-branch". VMIPS 1.2.2 itself can be checked out using the tag
"release-1-2-2".

   Please refer to the bug reporting instructions in the VMIPS manual
if you have trouble using the software.
