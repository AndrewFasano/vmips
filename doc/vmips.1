.UC
.SH "NAME"
vmips \- \s-1VMIPS\s0 R3000\-based \s-1MIPS\s0 simulator (running and customizing)
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 4
\&  vmips [-D] [-o option_string] ... rom_file
\&  vmips --help
\&  vmips --version
\&  vmips --print-config
.Ve
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
When you invoke vmips, it loads a \s-1ROM\s0 file specified on the command line,
initializes and resets the \s-1MIPS\s0 processor, and begins execution at the first
address of the \s-1ROM\s0 file, which is normally loaded at address 0xbfc00000.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
This is what the different command line options mean:
.IP "\fB\-D\fR" 4
.IX Item "-D"
Turns on debugging of option parsing. This is not generally
useful to the end user unless you are confused about \s-1VMIPS\s0's
interpretation of your command line or startup file(s).
\&\s-1VMIPS\s0 has to be compiled with \-DOPTIONS_DEBUG for this option
to be available.
.IP "\fB\-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "--help"
Prints a short summary of \s-1VMIPS\s0 command line options, and exits
successfully.
.IP "\fB\-\-version\fR" 4
.IX Item "--version"
Prints a short summary of \s-1VMIPS\s0 version and copyright information,
and exits successfully.
.IP "\fB\-\-print\-config\fR" 4
.IX Item "--print-config"
Prints a short summary of \s-1VMIPS\s0 compile-time configuration information,
and exits successfully.
.IP "\fB\-o something\fR" 4
.IX Item "-o something"
Set the option \*(L"something\*(R" as if \*(L"something\*(R" were in your
\&.vmipsrc file.  See the \*(L"\s-1VMIPS\s0 options\*(R" section of the
\&\*(L"Customizing\*(R" chapter for more information on what kind
of things can go in your .vmipsrc file. You can use as many
\&\-o options on the command line as your shell will let you.
.IP "\fBrom_file\fR" 4
.IX Item "rom_file"
Use the named file as the \s-1ROM\s0 file \s-1VMIPS\s0 should boot. This
option is mandatory.
.SH "FILES"
.IX Header "FILES"
.Sh "\s-1VMIPS\s0 options"
.IX Subsection "VMIPS options"
The \s-1VMIPS\s0 simulator gets runtime options from four different sources,
in this order: first, it checks its compile-time defaults, which are
set by the site administrator in the source file \fIoptiontbl.h\fR. Then,
the system-wide configuration file is read; usually this is in
\&\fI/usr/local/share/vmipsrc\fR, but it may have been moved by the site
administrator. (This is configurable in the source file \fIoptions.h\fR, and
by specifying the \-\-prefix and \-\-sharedir options to the \s-1GNU\s0 \fBconfigure\fR
script when building \s-1VMIPS\s0.) Next, it checks the user's own configuration
file, usually the file \fI.vmipsrc\fR in your home directory. Last, it
reads the command line, and gets any options listed there.
.Sh "Format of the configuration file"
.IX Subsection "Format of the configuration file"
The configuration file may contain as many options per line as you want,
provided no line exceeds \s-1BUFSIZ\s0 (usually 1,024) characters.  Whitespace
separates options from one another. A string or number option named
\&\s-1NAME\s0 can appear as NAME=VALUE, where \s-1VALUE\s0 is the string or number
in question. If the number begins with 0x, it will be interpreted
as a 32\-bit hexadecimal number, and if it begins with 0, it will be
interpreted as octal. Otherwise, it will be interpreted as a decimal
number. Numbers are always unsigned. A Boolean option named \s-1NAME\s0 can
appear as either \s-1NAME\s0 (to set it to \s-1TRUE\s0) or noNAME (to set it to \s-1FALSE\s0).
.Sh "Summary of configuration options"
.IX Subsection "Summary of configuration options"
The following is a list of the configuration options present in this
version of \s-1VMIPS\s0.
.PP

.Ve
\&\fBexcpriomsg\fR (type: Boolean)
.PP
.Vb 4
\& Controls whether exception prioritizing messages will
\&        be printed.  These messages attempt to explain which of
\&        a number of exceptions caused by the same instruction
\&        will be reported.  The default value is FALSE.
.Ve
\&\fBexcmsg\fR (type: Boolean)
.PP
.Vb 6
\& Controls whether every exception will cause a message
\&        to be printed. The message gives the exception code, a
\&        short explanation of the exception code, its priority,
\&        the delay slot state of the virtual CPU, and states
\&        what type of memory access the exception was caused by,
\&        if applicable.  The default value is FALSE.
.Ve
\&\fBbootmsg\fR (type: Boolean)
.PP
.Vb 3
\& Controls whether boot-time and halt-time messages will be printed.
\&        These include ROM image size, self test messages, reset and halt
\&        announcements, and possibly other messages.  The default value is TRUE.
.Ve
\&\fBinstdump\fR (type: Boolean)
.PP
.Vb 11
\& Controls whether every instruction executed will be disassembled
\&        and printed.  The default value is TRUE. The output is in the following format:

\&        PC=0xbfc00000 [1fc00000]    24000000 li $zero,0
\&        @end example
\&        The first column contains the PC (program counter), followed by
\&        the physical translation of that address in brackets. The third
\&        column contains the machine instruction word at that address,
\&        followed by the assembly language corresponding to that word.
\&        All of the constants except for the assembly language are in
\&        hexadecimal.
.Ve
\&\fBdumpcpu\fR (type: Boolean)
.PP
.Vb 10
\& Controls whether the CPU registers and stack will be dumped after every

\&        @end example
.Ve
.Vb 7
\&        (Some values have been omitted for brevity.)
\&        Here, PC is the program counter, LastInstr is the last instruction
\&        executed, HI and LO are the multiplication/division result registers,
\&        DelayState and DelayPC are used in delay slot processing, NextEPC
\&        is what the Exception PC would be if an exception were to occur, and

\&        uppercase if on, lowercase if off.
.Ve
\&\fBhaltibe\fR (type: Boolean)
.PP
.Vb 7
\& If B<haltibe> is set to TRUE, the virtual machine will halt
\&        after an instruction fetch causes a bus error (exception
\&        code 6, Instruction bus error). This is useful if you
\&        are expecting execution to jump to nonexistent addresses in
\&        memory, and you want it to stop instead of calling the
\&        exception handler.  It is important to note that the machine
\&        halts after the exception is processed.  The default value is TRUE.
.Ve
\&\fBhaltjrra\fR (type: Boolean)
.PP
.Vb 8
\& If B<haltjrra> is set to TRUE, the virtual machine will halt
\&        when the instruction "jr $31" (also written "jr $ra")
\&        is encountered.  Since this is the instruction for a
\&        procedure call to return, this is useful if you have
\&        a simple procedure to run and you want execution to
\&        terminate when it finishes. It is important to note that the
\&        machine halts after the jump instruction is processed, but
\&        before the instruction in the jump's delay slot is processed.  The default value is FALSE.
.Ve
\&\fBhaltbreak\fR (type: Boolean)
.PP
.Vb 5
\& If B<haltbreak> is set to TRUE, the virtual machine will halt
\&        when a breakpoint exception is encountered (exception
\&        code 9). This is equivalent to halting when a C<break>
\&        instruction is encountered. It is important to note that the
\&        machine halts after the breakpoint exception is processed.  The default value is TRUE.
.Ve
\&\fBhaltdevice\fR (type: Boolean)
.PP
.Vb 2
\& If B<haltdevice> is set to TRUE, the halt device is mapped into
\&        physical memory, otherwise it is not.  The default value is TRUE.
.Ve
\&\fBinstcounts\fR (type: Boolean)
.PP
.Vb 8
\& Set B<instcounts> to TRUE if you want to see instruction
\&        counts, a rough estimate of total runtime, and execution
\&        speed in instructions per second when the virtual
\&        machine halts.  The default value is FALSE.  The output is printed
\&        at the end of the run, and is in the following format:
\&        @example
\&        7337 instructions in 0.0581 seconds (126282.271 instructions per second)
\&        @end example
.Ve
\&\fBromfile\fR (type: string)
.PP
.Vb 4
\& This is the name of the file which will be initially
\&        loaded into memory (at the address given in B<loadaddr>,
\&        typically 0xbfc00000) and executed when the virtual
\&        machine is reset.  The default value is "romfile.rom".
.Ve
\&\fBconfigfile\fR (type: string)
.PP
.Vb 3
\& This is the name of the user configuration file. It
\&        will be ~username-expanded and checked for configuration
\&        options before the virtual machine boots.  The default value is "~/.vmipsrc".
.Ve
\&\fBloadaddr\fR (type: number)
.PP
.Vb 9
\& This is the virtual address where the ROM will be loaded.
\&        Note that the MIPS reset exception vector is always 0xbfc00000
\&        so unless you're doing something incredibly clever you should
\&        plan to have some executable code at that address. Since the
\&        caches and TLB are in an indeterminate state at the time of
\&        reset, the load address must be in uncacheable memory which
\&        is not mapped through the TLB (kernel segment "kseg1"). This
\&        effectively constrains the valid range of load addresses to
\&        between 0xa0000000 and 0xc0000000.  The default value is 0xbfc00000.
.Ve
\&\fBmemsize\fR (type: number)
.PP
.Vb 2
\& This variable controls the size of the virtual CPU's "physical"
\&        memory in bytes.  The default value is 0x100000.
.Ve
\&\fBmemdump\fR (type: Boolean)
.PP
.Vb 3
\& If B<memdump> is set, then the virtual machine will dump its RAM
\&        into a file, whose name is given by the B<memdumpfile> option,
\&        at the end of the simulation run.  The default value is FALSE.
.Ve
\&\fBmemdumpfile\fR (type: string)
.PP
.Vb 2
\& This is the name of the file to which a RAM dump will be
\&        written at the end of the simulation run.  The default value is "memdump.bin".
.Ve
\&\fBreportirq\fR (type: Boolean)
.PP
.Vb 2
\& If B<reportirq> is set, then any change in the interrupt
\&        inputs from a device will be reported on stderr.  The default value is FALSE.
.Ve
\&\fBusetty\fR (type: Boolean)
.PP
.Vb 3
\& If B<usetty> is set, then the SPIM-compatible console device
\&        will be configured. If it is not set, then no console device will be
\&        available to the virtual machine.  The default value is TRUE.
.Ve
\&\fBttydev\fR (type: string)
.PP
.Vb 6
\& This pathname will be used as the device from which reads from the
\&        SPIM-compatible console device's Keyboard 1 will take their data, and
\&        to which writes to Display 1 will send their data. If the OS supports
\&        ttyname(3), that call will be used to guess the default pathname.
\&        If the pathname is the single word B<off>, then the device will be

.Ve
\&\fBttydev2\fR (type: string)
.PP
.Vb 2
\& See B<ttydev> option; this one is just like it, but pertains

.Ve
\&\fBdebug\fR (type: Boolean)
.PP
.Vb 5
\& If debug is set, then the gdb remote serial protocol backend will
\&        be enabled in the virtual machine. This will cause the machine to
\&        wait for gdb to attach and B<continue> before booting the ROM file.
\&        If debug is not set, then the machine will boot the ROM file
\&        without pausing.  The default value is FALSE.
.Ve
\&\fBrealtime\fR (type: Boolean)
.PP
.Vb 4
\& If B<realtime> is set, then the clock device will cause simulated

\&        will run at the speed given by the B<clockspeed> option.   The default value is FALSE.
.Ve
\&\fBtimeratio\fR (type: number)
.PP
.Vb 3
\& If the B<realtime> option is set, this option gives the
