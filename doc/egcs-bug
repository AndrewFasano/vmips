Bugs in EGCS dealing with kernel code
-------------------------------------

 EGCS 1.1.1 configured as a cross-compiler from i586-pc-linux-gnu
 to mips-dec-ultrix4.5 using --with-gnu-as --with-gnu-ld
 --enable-version-specific-runtime-libs will not disregard the return type
 of main even if you use -Wno-main, and will not refrain from trying to use
 __main to set up C library type things even if you use -ffreestanding.
 The -Wno-main thing is probably a bug; the -ffreestanding thing is by
 design, according to the gcc people.

 There is probably a better way to configure cross compilers for VMIPS,
 which will go into the docs once it is discovered; this will alleviate
 the -ffreestanding lossage.

 I think the -Wno-main thing should be fixed by the time GCC3.0 comes
 around...

 I'm able to get around the bug by calling the entry function ``entry''
 instead of ``main'', so it's not a show-stopper.
