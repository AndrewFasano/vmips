@c man begin DESCRIPTION
When you invoke vmips, it loads a ROM file specified on the command line,
initializes and resets the MIPS processor, and begins execution at the first
address of the ROM file, which is normally loaded at address 0xbfc00000.

@chapter Invoking vmips

VMIPS is started by running the "vmips" program from the command line.
The format of the VMIPS command line is any one of the following:

@c man begin SYNOPSIS
@example
vmips [-D] [-o option_string] ... rom_file
vmips --help
vmips --version
vmips --print-config
@end example
@c man end

@c man begin OPTIONS
This is what the different command line options mean:

@table @samp
@item -D
Turns on debugging of option parsing. This is not generally
useful to the end user unless you are confused about VMIPS's
interpretation of your command line or startup file(s).
VMIPS has to be compiled with -DOPTIONS_DEBUG for this option
to be available.

@item --help
Prints a short summary of VMIPS command line options, and exits
successfully.

@item --version
Prints a short summary of VMIPS version and copyright information,
and exits successfully.

@item --print-config
Prints a short summary of VMIPS compile-time configuration information,
and exits successfully.

@item -o something
Set the option "something" as if "something" were in your
.vmipsrc file.  See the "VMIPS options" section of the
"Customizing" chapter for more information on what kind
of things can go in your .vmipsrc file. You can use as many
-o options on the command line as your shell will let you.

@cindex ROM, selecting file for
@item rom_file
Use the named file as the ROM file VMIPS should boot. This
option is mandatory.
@end table
@c man end

@section VMIPS options

The VMIPS simulator gets runtime options from four different sources,
in this order: first, it checks its compile-time defaults, which are
set by the site administrator in the source file @file{optiontbl.h}. Then,
the system-wide configuration file is read; usually this is in
@file{/usr/local/share/vmipsrc}, but it may have been moved by the site
administrator. (This is configurable in the source file @file{options.h}, and
by specifying the --prefix and --sharedir options to the GNU @command{configure}
script when building VMIPS.) Next, it checks the user's own configuration
file, usually the file @file{.vmipsrc} in your home directory. Last, it
reads the command line, and gets any options listed there.

@section Format of the configuration file

The configuration file may contain as many options per line as you want,
provided no line exceeds BUFSIZ (usually 1,024) characters.  Whitespace
separates options from one another. A string or number option named
NAME can appear as NAME=VALUE, where VALUE is the string or number
in question. If the number begins with 0x, it will be interpreted
as a 32-bit hexadecimal number, and if it begins with 0, it will be
interpreted as octal. Otherwise, it will be interpreted as a decimal
number. Numbers are always unsigned. A Boolean option named NAME can
appear as either NAME (to set it to TRUE) or noNAME (to set it to FALSE).

@section Summary of configuration options

The following is a list of the configuration options present in this
version of VMIPS.
