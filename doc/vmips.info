Overview
********

   VMIPS is a simulator for a machine compatible with the MIPS R3000
RISC architecture. VMIPS consists entirely of software; no special
hardware is required to run programs on VMIPS--that is, VMIPS is a
virtual machine.

   Since VMIPS is based on an already-existing architecture, it is
relatively easy to find tools to build programs that will run on VMIPS.
Since VMIPS is based on a RISC architecture, its primitive
machine-language commands are all fairly simple to understand.

   VMIPS is easily extended by programmers to include more virtual
devices, such as frame buffers, disk drives, etc. VMIPS is written in
C++ and uses a fairly simple class structure. Furthermore, VMIPS is
intended to be a "concrete" virtual machine which its users can modify
at will--"concrete" meaning that it maintains a tight correspondence
between its structures and structures which actually appear in modern
physical computer hardware.  For example, a programmer who wished to
modify the CPU simulation could easily extract the `CPU' class from the
VMIPS source code, and replace it with one which was more to his/her
liking.

   VMIPS is also designed with debugging and testing in mind, offering
an interface to the GNU debugger GDB by which programs can be debugged
while they run on the simulator. As such, it is intended to be a
practical simulator target for compilers and assembly
language/hardware-software interface courses.

   VMIPS is free software. This means that you are free to share VMIPS
with everyone, and we encourage you to do so, but we do not give you
the freedom to restrict others from sharing it with everyone. For a
comprehensive explanation please read the GNU General Public License.

Getting Started
***************

   Step 0. If VMIPS is installed on your system, you can start building
programs with it right away.  Otherwise, you (or your system
administrator) will have to compile VMIPS first; see the appendix on
Installation.

   Step 1. First, compile your program. You should have a MIPS
cross-compiler available.  VMIPS supports the GNU C Compiler; most
installations of VMIPS will also have an installation of the GNU C
Compiler targetting the MIPS architecture.  Your easiest interface to
the C compiler will probably be through the `vmipstool' program; to run
the MIPS compiler that VMIPS was installed with, use the `vmipstool
--compile' command.

   Step 2. Link your program with any support code necessary. VMIPS
comes with some canned support code, in the share/setup directory, or
you can write your own support code. VMIPS comes with a linker script
for simple standalone programs, which you can run with `vmipstool
--link', or you can write your own linker script.

   Step 3. Build a ROM image. This is necessary because the current
version of VMIPS does not read in executables. Most real machines
don't; they have an embedded program on a piece of flash ROM that reads
in the first executable and runs it. This makes development a little
more realistic, but not quite so convenient; this may change in the
future, but for now it's necessary. To build a ROM image, use the
script that comes with VMIPS, by running `vmipstool --make-rom'.

   Step 4. Start the simulator using `vmips ROMFILE', where `ROMFILE' is
the name of your ROM image.  Your program should run to completion, and
if you are using the canned setup code that comes with VMIPS, the
simulator should halt when it hits the first `break' instruction, which
should happen right after your `entry' function returns.


File: vmips.info,  Node: An Example,  Next: Building Programs,  Prev: Getting Started,  Up: Top

An Example
**********

   Let's assume you have VMIPS already compiled, and that you have some
setup code in `setup.s', and a standalone program (i.e., not one meant
to run under an operating system) in `hello.c'.

   First assemble the setup code.
     vmipstool --assemble -o setup.o setup.s

   Compile your program:
     vmipstool --compile -c hello.c

   Then, link your program and the setup code together to produce an
executable:
     vmipstool --link -o hello setup.o hello.o

   Build a ROM image from the executable:
     vmipstool --make-rom hello hello.rom

   Run the program.
     vmips hello.rom

   The program will terminate, by default, when your setup code
generates a breakpoint exception (using the `break' instruction, for
example). This termination condition can be changed by adding one of the
`halt' options to the file `.vmipsrc' in your home directory.

Building Programs
*****************

Source Languages
================

   Programs for VMIPS are generally built out of C or assembly-language
source code. It is theoretically possible to use C++ or other
languages, but the infrastructure required has not yet been
investigated or documented.

ROM Programs
============

   The easiest way to get VMIPS to run a program is to install that
program as the VMIPS ROM. Building a C program as a ROM requires that
you link it with some setup code.

Default Setup Code
==================

   This section describes the default VMIPS setup code.  It also
describes the minimal set of things you need to do before you can run C
code from the ROM, since that is the intended purpose of the default
VMIPS setup code.

   Start by clearing out registers and TLB entries.

   Set yourself up a stack pointer ($sp). Usually this can just be some
number of megabytes above the end of your code's data segment.  You can
get the address of the end of your code's data segment from your linker
script.

   Set up your globals pointer ($gp), if your code uses global data.
You can get the right address from your linker script.

   If you have writable data in ROM, your C code probably doesn't
realize that it's in ROM, and it will want to write to it. You should
copy the writable data to RAM. There is code to do this in the canned
setup code provided with VMIPS.

   Finally, your setup code should finish by calling the entry point of
your C code. Usually this will have a name like `entry'; using the name
`main' is not recommended, because many versions of GCC assume that
they can call standard C runtime setup functions (such as are normally
found in `crt0.o') from the beginning of `main'. You may or may not
want this.

   When the C code returns, you will probably want to halt the machine;
the default way to do this is by executing a break instruction. Read the
following section for details.

Exceptions
==========

Handling exceptions
-------------------

   Your startup code should have some kind of exception support.  If you
don't, exceptions are likely to make your program loop forever, because
the jump to the exception vector will result in the execution of garbage
or in a unmapped access, either of which are likely to cause exceptions.

   An absolutely minimal exception handler is a break instruction at
address 0xbfc00180, which will halt the machine on any exception,
providing you have the `haltbreak' option set. This is also a handy way
to halt the machine after your program ends, if you are writing kernel
code; just follow the jump to your kernel code by a `break' instruction.

Exception vectors
-----------------

   If the Boot-time Exception Vectors are in use, exceptions use the
base address 0xbfc00100 (which is in unmapped, uncached kernel space),
otherwise they use the base address 0x80000000 (which is in unmapped,
cached kernel space).  You can control this by setting or clearing the
Boot-time Exception Vector bit (bit 22, or 0x00400000) in the Status
register (register 12 of coprocessor zero). If the bit is set, the
Boot-time Exception Vectors will be used.

   User-space TLB Miss exceptions have a special vector, which is
obtained by adding 0 to the base address. All other exceptions use the
general vector, which is obtained by adding 0x080 to the base address.
This obviously places a bit of a restriction on the layout of the
beginning of your ROM code: the setup code must either fit in the first
0x100 bytes, or it must be structured so that it jumps past the
exception vectors.

Exception codes and their meanings
----------------------------------

   Whenever control is transferred to your exception handler, the
ExcCode field of the Cause register, that is, bits 6 - 2 (0x007c) of
register 13 of coprocessor 0, are filled in with one of the following
exception codes.  Each exception code has a canonical short name,
included in parentheses next to the exception code number, and is
followed by a short description of the circumstances where it occurs.

`0 (Int)'
     Hardware or software interrupt. Some device or process is trying
     to get the processor's attention.

`1 (Mod)'
     TLB modification exception. The memory address translation mapped
     to a TLB entry, but that entry's "dirty" bit was set.

`2 (TLBL)'
     TLB exception caused by a data load (i.e., a load word or similar
     instruction) or instruction fetch. The memory address translation
     did not match any valid TLB entry.

`3 (TLBS)'
     TLB exception caused by a data store (i.e., a store word or similar
     instruction). The memory address translation did not match any
     valid TLB entry.

`4 (AdEL)'
     Address error exception caused by a data load or instruction
     fetch. The PC was not word-aligned, or the address the load
     instruction wanted to load from was not aligned to the width of
     the load instruction. (For example, load halfword instructions
     must be 2-byte aligned.)

`5 (AdES)'
     Address error exception caused by a data store. The address the
     store instruction wanted to store to was not aligned to the width
     of the store instruction. (For example, store halfword
     instructions must be 2-byte aligned.)

`6 (IBE)'
     Bus error caused by an instruction fetch. The PC does not
     correspond to any real area of memory.

`7 (DBE)'
     Bus error caused by a data load or store. The target address of
     the load or store instruction does not correspond to any real area
     of memory.

`8 (Sys)'
     SYSCALL exception. Some code was trying to call the operating
     system, using a SYSCALL instruction.  This exception is the
     processor's way of transferring control to the operating system.

`9 (Bp)'
     Breakpoint exception. Some process executed a BREAK instruction.
     This is the processor's way of allowing the operating system to
     stop the process and do whatever is appropriate (alert the user
     using the debugger, for example).

`10 (RI)'
     Reserved instruction exception. Some code executed something which
     wasn't a valid MIPS-1 instruction.

`11 (CpU)'
     Coprocessor Unusable. Some code executed an instruction which
     tried to reference a coprocessor that isn't configured in VMIPS.

`12 (Ov)'
     Arithmetic Overflow.  Some code executed an instruction whose
     arithmetic answer was too big to fit in a register using
     two's-complement arithmetic. The processor issues this exception
     so that the operating system can stop or otherwise signal the
     process.

`13 (Tr)'
     Trap. This exception is only issued on the R4000 or R6000
     processor and compatibles.

`14 (NCD)'
     LDCz or SDCz (coprocessor load/store) using an address which
     wasn't in the cache. This exception is only issued on the R6000
     processor and compatibles.

`14 (VCEI)'
     Virtual Coherency Exception (instruction). This exception is only
     issued on the R4000 processor and compatibles.

`15 (MV)'
     Machine check exception. This exception is only issued on the
     R6000 processor and compatibles.

`15 (FPE)'
     Floating-point exception. This exception is only issued on the
     R4000 processor and compatibles.

`16-22'
     Reserved, not used.

`23 (WATCH)'
     Reference to WatchHi/WatchLo address detected. This exception is
     only issued on the R4000 processor and compatibles.

`24-30'
     Reserved, not used.

`31 (VCED)'
     Virtual Coherency Exception (data). This exception is only issued
     on the R4000 processor and compatibles.

Exception prioritizing
----------------------

   It is possible for more than one exception to occur during the
emulation of the same instruction.  The MIPS architecture has a system
for determining which of a set of conflicting exceptions is reported to
the exception handler.

   When two or more exceptions occur on the same execution of the same
instruction, only one is reported, according to the priority list,
below. The ordering is by exception code (EXCCODE) and mode of memory
access (MODE), where applicable. Each ordered pair (EXCCODE, MODE)
below has the priority listed in brackets. * denotes a position where
any value matches.

   This prioritization is implemented in the `exception_priority()'
member function of class CPU.

`[1]'
     Address error - instruction fetch (AdEL, INSTFETCH)

`[2]'
     TLB refill - instruction fetch TLB invalid - instruction fetch
     (TLBL, INSTFETCH) (TLBS, INSTFETCH)

`[3]'
     Bus error - instruction fetch (IBE, *)

`[4]'
     Integer overflow, Trap, System call, Breakpoint, Reserved
     Instruction, or Coprocessor Unusable (Ov, *) (Tr, *) (Sys, *) (Bp,
     *) (RI, *) (CpU, *)

`[5]'
     Address error - data load or data store (AdEL, DATALOAD) (AdES, *)

`[6]'
     TLB refill - data load or data store TLB invalid - data load or
     data store (TLBL, DATALOAD) (TLBS, DATALOAD) (TLBL, DATASTORE)
     (TLBS, DATASTORE)

`[7]'
     TLB modified - data store (Mod, *)

`[8]'
     Bus error - data load or data store (DBE, *)

`[9]'
     Interrupt (Int, *)

Linking
=======

   You want the text section of your program to start with the setup
code, so link in the setup code first -- that is, put the name of the
object file containing the setup code first on the linker command line.

   You want the setup code to start at 0xbfc00000, which is the MIPS
reset exception vector. In practical terms, when VMIPS starts up, it
will reset. When VMIPS resets, it jumps to 0xbfc00000, which is the
beginning of your setup code.

Common Errors in Compilation
============================

   If the linker complains about not being able to find the symbol
`_gp_disp', you should turn on the GCC option `-mno-abicalls'.
`_gp_disp' is used by the SGI N32 ABI for MIPS ELF.  One reliable
reference source claims, "`_gp_disp' is a reserved symbol defined by
the linker to be the distance between the lui instruction and the
context pointer." The GNU linkers currently in use do not appear to
support this function.

   If you get lots of `R_MIPS_GPREL16' relocation failures from the
linker, there are two workarounds: either combine all the files
together first with `ld -x -r -o bigfile.o <ALL YOUR FILES>' and then
use `vmipstool --link' on `bigfile.o', or compile with `-G 0' in your
`CFLAGS'.

Dealing with kernel code in GCC
-------------------------------

   If you have a `main()' function in your code, GCC expects it to
return an int.  If you don't like this, use `-ffreestanding' or
`-Wno-main'. You have to have GCC 2.95.2 for this to work, though; it
won't work in EGCS 1.1.1.

   If you have a `main()' function in your code, GCC will try to call
`__main' or some other kind of setup function even if you use
`-ffreestanding'.  There is probably a way to configure the cross
compiler so that it won't try to do this;  it will be documented here
once it is discovered.  A simple workaround is to call the entry
function `entry' instead of `main'.

Building ROMs
-------------

   If it takes a long time to build a ROM or the ROM file fills the
disk, make sure all the sections your linker is producing are accounted
for in the linker script. Do an `objdump -x' on the executable which
you are using to build the ROM image, and make sure that the difference
between any two of the LMAs (load memory addresses) of the sections in
the file is not a lot bigger than the total size of the executable.
This metric is strictly a rule of thumb, but it easily identifies when
a section has not been put into the linker script: if a load memory
address for some section is expecting to be in RAM (0xa0000000, for
example), and the load memory address for all the other sections is in
ROM (around 0xbfc00000), then you will lose because writing out a memory
image to be used as a ROM file would take roughly 0xbfc00000 -
0xa0000000 = 532676608 bytes (about 500 megs). The solution is to make
sure that all LMAs in the executable are sane with respect to the
`loadaddr' variable in your `.vmipsrc', usually by adding any new
sections you find to either the .text, .data, or .bss section of the
linker script.

Invoking vmips
**************

   VMIPS is started by running the "vmips" program from the command
line.  The format of the VMIPS command line is any one of the following:

     vmips [-D] [-o option_string] ... rom_file
     vmips --help
     vmips --version
     vmips --print-config

   This is what the different command line options mean:

`-D'
     Turns on debugging of option parsing. This is not generally useful
     to the end user unless you are confused about VMIPS's
     interpretation of your command line or startup file(s).  VMIPS has
     to be compiled with -DOPTIONS_DEBUG for this option to be
     available.

`--help'
     Prints a short summary of VMIPS command line options, and exits
     successfully.

`--version'
     Prints a short summary of VMIPS version and copyright information,
     and exits successfully.

`--print-config'
     Prints a short summary of VMIPS compile-time configuration
     information, and exits successfully.

`-o something'
     Set the option "something" as if "something" were in your .vmipsrc
     file.  See the "VMIPS options" section of the "Customizing"
     chapter for more information on what kind of things can go in your
     .vmipsrc file. You can use as many -o options on the command line
     as your shell will let you.

`rom_file'
     Use the named file as the ROM file VMIPS should boot. This option
     is mandatory.

Customizing
***********

VMIPS options
=============

   The VMIPS simulator gets runtime options from four different sources,
in this order: first, it checks its compile-time defaults, which are
set by the site administrator in the source file `optiontbl.h'. Then,
the system-wide configuration file is read; usually this is in
`/usr/local/share/vmipsrc', but it may have been moved by the site
administrator. (This is configurable in the source file `options.h', and
by specifying the -prefix and -sharedir options to the GNU `configure'
script when building VMIPS.) Next, it checks the user's own
configuration file, usually the file `.vmipsrc' in your home directory.
Last, it reads the command line, and gets any options listed there.

Format of the configuration file
================================

   The configuration file may contain as many options per line as you
want, provided no line exceeds BUFSIZ (usually 1,024) characters.
Whitespace separates options from one another. A string or number
option named NAME can appear as NAME=VALUE, where VALUE is the string
or number in question. If the number begins with 0x, it will be
interpreted as a 32-bit hexadecimal number, and if it begins with 0, it
will be interpreted as octal. Otherwise, it will be interpreted as a
decimal number. Numbers are always unsigned. A Boolean option named
NAME can appear as either NAME (to set it to TRUE) or noNAME (to set it
to FALSE).

Summary of configuration options
================================

   The following is a list of the configuration options present in this
version of VMIPS.

   `haltdumpcpu' (type: Boolean)

   Controls whether the CPU registers will be dumped on halt. The
default value is FALSE.

   `haltdumpcp0' (type: Boolean)

   Controls whether the system control coprocessor (CP0) registers will
be dumped on halt. The default value is FALSE.

   `excpriomsg' (type: Boolean)

   Controls whether exception prioritizing messages will be printed.
These messages attempt to explain which of a number of exceptions
caused by the same instruction will be reported. The default value is
FALSE.

   `excmsg' (type: Boolean)

   Controls whether every exception will cause a message to be printed.
The message gives the exception code, a short explanation of the
exception code, its priority, the delay slot state of the virtual CPU,
and states what type of memory access the exception was caused by, if
applicable. The default value is FALSE.

   `bootmsg' (type: Boolean)

   Controls whether boot-time and halt-time messages will be printed.
These include ROM image size, self test messages, reset and halt
announcements, and possibly other messages. The default value is TRUE.

   `instdump' (type: Boolean)

   Controls whether every instruction executed will be disassembled and
printed.  The default value is TRUE. The output is in the following
format:
     PC=0xbfc00000 [1fc00000] 24000000 li $zero,0
   The first column contains the PC (program counter), followed by the
physical translation of that address in brackets. The third column
contains the machine instruction word at that address, followed by the
assembly language corresponding to that word.  All of the constants
except for the assembly language are in hexadecimal.

   `dumpcpu' (type: Boolean)

   Controls whether the CPU registers will be dumped after every
instruction.  The default value is FALSE. The output is in the
following format:
     Reg Dump: PC=bfc00080 Last Instr=241f001f HI=00000000 LO=00000000
     DELAY_STATE = NORMAL ; DELAY_PC=00000000 ; NEXT_EPC = bfc0007c
     R00=00000000 R01=00000001 R02=00000002 R03=00000003 R04=00000004
     ...
     R30=0000001e R31=0000001f
   (Some values have been omitted for brevity.)  Here, PC is the
program counter, Last Instr is the last instruction executed, HI and LO
are the multiplication/division result registers, DELAY_STATE and
DELAY_PC are used in delay slot processing, NEXT_EPC is what the
Exception PC would be if an exception were to occur, and R00 ... R31
are the CPU general purpose registers. All values are in hexadecimal.

   `dumpcp0' (type: Boolean)

   Controls whether the system control coprocessor (CP0) registers will
be dumped after every instruction.   The default value is FALSE. The
output is in the following format:
     CP0 Dump Registers:
     R00=00000100 R01=00001f00 R02=06a5ee00 R03=00000000
     R04=7fffca10 R05=00000000 R06=00000000 R07=00000000
     R08=7fb7e0aa R09=00000000 R10=6f6dd980 R11=00000000
     R12=00485e18 R13=30002110 R14=4c04a8af R15=0000703b
   Each of the R00 .. R15 are coprocessor zero registers.  Their values
are displayed in hexadecimal.

   `haltibe' (type: Boolean)

   If haltibe is set to TRUE, the virtual machine will halt when an
instruction fetch causes a bus error (exception code 6, Instruction bus
error). This is useful if you are expecting execution to jump into
unmapped areas of memory, and you want it to stop instead of calling the
exception handler. The default value is TRUE.

   `haltjrra' (type: Boolean)

   If haltjrra is set to TRUE, the virtual machine will halt when the
instruction "jr $31" (also written "jr $ra") is encountered. Since this
is the instruction for a procedure call to return, this is useful if
you have a simple procedure to run and you want execution to terminate
when it finishes. The default value is FALSE.

   `haltbreak' (type: Boolean)

   If haltbreak is set to TRUE, the virtual machine will halt when a
breakpoint exception is encountered (exception code 9). This is
equivalent to halting when a "break" instruction is encountered. The
default value is TRUE.

   `instcounts' (type: Boolean)

   Set instcounts to TRUE if you want to see instruction counts, a
rough estimate of total runtime, and execution speed in instructions
per second when the virtual machine halts.  The default value is FALSE.
The output is printed at the end of the run, and is in the following
format:
     733737 instructions executed in 5.81484 seconds
     126183.545 instructions per second

   `romfile' (type: string)

   This is the name of the file which will be initially loaded into
memory (at the address given in "loadaddr", typically 0xbfc00000) and
executed when the virtual machine is reset. The default value is
"romfile.rom".

   `configfile' (type: string)

   This is the name of the user configuration file. It will be
~username-expanded and checked for configuration options before the
virtual machine boots. The default value is "~/.vmipsrc".

   `loadaddr' (type: number)

   This is the virtual address where the ROM will be loaded.  Note that
the MIPS reset exception vector is always 0xbfc00000 so unless you're
doing something incredibly clever you should plan to have some
executable code at that address. Since the caches and TLB are in an
indeterminate state at the time of reset, the load address must be in
uncacheable memory which is not mapped through the TLB (kernel segment
"kseg1"). This effectively constrains the valid range of load addresses
to between 0xa0000000 and 0xc0000000. The default value is 0xbfc00000.

   `memsize' (type: number)

   This variable controls the size of the virtual CPU's "physical"
memory in bytes. You might want to round this off to the nearest page;
you can determine the pagesize using utils/getpagesize.cc. The default
value is 0x100000.

   `memdump' (type: Boolean)

   If memdump is set, then the virtual machine will dump its RAM into a
file named "memdump.bin" at the end of processing. The default value is
FALSE.

   `reportirq' (type: Boolean)

   If reportirq is set, then any change in the interrupt inputs from a
device will be reported on stderr. The default value is FALSE.

   `usetty' (type: Boolean)

   If usetty is set, then the SPIM-compatible console device will be
configured. If it is not set, then no console device will be available
to the virtual machine. The default value is TRUE.

   `ttydev' (type: string)

   This pathname will be used as the device from which reads from the
console device will take their data, and to which writes to the console
device will send their data. If the OS supports ttyname(3), that call
will be used to guess the default pathname. The default value is
"/dev/tty".

   `debug' (type: Boolean)

   If debug is set, then the gdb remote serial protocol backend will be
enabled in the virtual machine. This will cause the machine to wait for
gdb to attach and "continue" before booting the ROM file.  If debug is
not set, then the machine will boot the ROM file without pausing. The
default value is FALSE.

   `realtime' (type: Boolean)

   If realtime is set, then the clock device will cause simulated time
to run at some fraction of real time, determined by the `timeratio'
option. If realtime is not set, then simulated time will run at the
speed given by the `clockspeed' option. The default value is FALSE.

   `timeratio' (type: number)

   If the realtime option is set, this option gives the number of times
slower than real time at which simulated time will run. It has no
effect if realtime is not set. The default value is 200.

   `clockspeed' (type: number)

   If the realtime option is not set, this option gives the speed of
simulated time in Hz. It has no effect if realtime is set. The default
value is 25000000.

   `clockintr' (type: number)

   This option gives the frequency of clock interrupts, in nanoseconds
of simulated time. The default value is 1000.

Invoking vmipstool
******************

   `vmipstool' is intended to be a friendly front-end to the process of
compiling, linking, and assembling code for VMIPS.

   The format of the vmipstool command line is as follows:

     vmipstool [ --verbose ] [ --dry-run ] --compile [ FLAGS ]
         FILE.c -o FILE.o
     vmipstool [ --verbose ] [ --dry-run ] --preprocess [ FLAGS ] FILE
     vmipstool [ --verbose ] [ --dry-run ] --assemble [ FLAGS ]
         FILE.s -o FILE.o
     vmipstool [ --verbose ] [ --dry-run ] [ --ld-script=T ] --link
         [ FLAGS ] FILE1.o ... FILEn.o -o PROG
     vmipstool [ --verbose ] [ --dry-run ] --make-rom PROG PROG.rom
     vmipstool [ --verbose ] [ --dry-run ] --disassemble-rom PROG.rom
     vmipstool [ --verbose ] [ --dry-run ] --disassemble PROG (or FILE.o)
     vmipstool --help
     vmipstool --version

   This is what the different command line options mean:

`--help'
     Display this help message and exit.

`--version'
     Display the version of vmipstool and exit.

`--verbose'
     Echo commands as they are run.

`--dry-run'
     Don't actually run anything; use with -verbose.

`--ld-script=T'
     Use T as the linker script (instead of default script); use with
     -link.

`--compile'
     Compile C code.  The remainder of the command line must consist of
     arguments to the GNU C compiler.

`--preprocess'
     Preprocess C source code or assembly code. The remainder of the
     command line must consist of arguments to the GNU C preprocessor.

`--assemble'
     Translate assembly code to object files. The remainder of the
     command line must consist of arguments to the GNU assembler.

`--link'
     Link objects together to create an executable. The remainder of
     the command line must consist of arguments to the GNU linker.

`--make-rom'
     Write a program into a ROM file. The next 2 arguments are the
     executable and the ROM file, respectively.

`--disassemble'
     Disassemble a relocatable object file (*.o file) or an executable.

`--disassemble-rom'
     Disassemble arbitrary data, possibly including ROM files. (More
     information is available with -disassemble, but it only works on
     programs which have not been written into ROMs.)

Programming
***********

   In this section we attempt to give some hints about writing code for
VMIPS.  They are primarily intended for assembly language programmers,
but should be helpful to anyone interested in the MIPS architecture.
This section will not replace a good MIPS reference; check the
"References" section for more information about these. However, any
help is appreciated for making this section more complete.

Delay slot handling
===================

   MIPS branch instructions' effects are delayed by one instruction;
the instruction following the branch instruction is always executed,
regardless of whether the branch is taken. This is a consequence of the
pipeline which is not important to virtual machine architecture, except
that it has to be emulated correctly.

   VMIPS emulates delay slot handling by means of a tiny state machine,
whose state is called the delay state.  The virtual CPU can be in a
delay state of `DELAYING', `DELAYSLOT', or `NORMAL' at the beginning of
the call to `periodic()'. The VMIPS delay slot state machine's state is
displayed when you use the `dumpcpu' option. See the "Summary of
configuration options" section of the "Customizing" chapter for more
information about this option.

   A delay state of `NORMAL' corresponds to execution in the non-branch
case.

   A delay state of `DELAYING' means that the instruction being executed
caused a branch to be taken, and the next instruction to execute is in
the delay slot.

   A delay state of `DELAYSLOT' means that the instruction just executed
was in the delay slot, and the next instruction to execute is the
branch target.  If there is an exception, the exception PC will be the
PC of the branch instruction, not of this one.

Debugging
*********

   VMIPS supports debugging through an interface to GDB, the GNU
debugger.  GDB talks to VMIPS using its built-in remote serial protocol.
See the "Remote Serial" section of the GDB manual for details of the
protocol.

   If you want to take advantage of the VMIPS GDB interface, set the
"debug" flag on the command line. VMIPS will wait for you to attach GDB
and type "continue" at the GDB prompt before booting the ROM file.

   To attach GDB to VMIPS, look for the line in the VMIPS startup
message that reads:

     Use this command to attach debugger: target remote 127.0.0.1:3371

   (The host and port numbers (127.0.0.1:3371) may be different on your
machine.)  When VMIPS pauses and says "Waiting for connection from
debugger", open up GDB in another window or on another terminal on the
program you are debugging. Do not try to open GDB on the ROM file,
because GDB doesn't understand ROM files; rather, give GDB the name of
the program you used to create the ROM file. Then type the "target
remote..."  command that VMIPS printed out, and GDB will connect to
VMIPS, which will be stopped at the first instruction of your setup
code. Then you can set breakpoints, single step, or just let the
program continue. VMIPS will return control to GDB on exceptions.

   Here is what the whole setup process looks like in VMIPS:

     % ./vmips -o debug boot.rom
     Auto-size ROM image: 4096 words.
     Running self tests.
     Little-Endian host processor detected.
     Self tests passed.

GDB, VMIPS and Signals
======================

   Since VMIPS does not know what operating system you are running on
it, and GDB does not believe in hardware exceptions (only operating
system signals), VMIPS has its own mapping of hardware exceptions to
signals.

   The mapping is as follows: Each signal is followed by a list of the
hardware exceptions that map to it.

SIGINT
        * Interrupt

SIGSEGV
        * TLB modification exception

        * TLB exception (load or instruction fetch)

        * TLB exception (store)

        * Address error exception (load or instruction fetch)

        * Address error exception (store)

SIGBUS
        * Instruction bus error

        * Data (load or store) bus error

SIGTRAP
        * SYSCALL exception

        * Breakpoint exception (BREAK instruction)

        * Processor reset (only at VMIPS startup)

SIGILL
        * Reserved instruction exception

SIGFPE
        * Coprocessor Unusable

        * Arithmetic Overflow

SIGHUP
        * (Anything else.)

Startup behavior
----------------

   Upon connecting to the VMIPS socket, gdb asks for the number of the
signal that stopped VMIPS. Of course, there was no exception, since no
instructions have executed, but we have to give a reason anyway. The
signal that is always returned is the signal corresponding to the
breakpoint exception - hence the listing for processor reset in the
signal table above, even though reset is not really an ordinary
exception.

GDB remote serial protocol implementation
=========================================

   The GDB remote serial protocol supports lots of packets, but VMIPS
does not support all of them.  The following subset of the GDB remote
serial protocol is implemented.

   * packet 'g': Read registers

   * packet 'G': Write registers

   * packet 'm': Read memory

   * packet 'M': Write memory

   * packet 'c': Continue

   * packet 's': Single step

   * packet 'k': Kill target

   * packet 'H': Set thread

   * packet '?': What was the last signal?

ROM Breakpoints
===============

   VMIPS supports the setting of breakpoints in ROM.  This would not be
extraordinary except that MIPS breakpoints are usually implemented by
GDB's remote serial protocol by overwriting instructions with MIPS break
instructions. VMIPS keeps a single bit for each word of ROM, in order
to tell whether that instruction is really a breakpoint. GDB keeps track
of setting and unsetting the breakpoints.

Devices
*******

   VMIPS comes with a few standard devices.

SPIM-compatible console device
==============================

   The SPIM-compatible Console Device models a serial controller with
two 200-baud full-duplex communication lines and a 1 Hz clock providing
timer interrupts. This console device is currently the standard console
device used in VMIPS.

Memory-mapped registers
-----------------------

   The SPIM-compatible console device communicates with the CPU by means
of a series of 9 32-bit-wide control and data registers, for a total of
36 memory-mapped bytes. The control registers are used for enabling and
disabling specific devices' interrupt request mechanisms, and for
determining which device(s) is/are ready for data when polling or during
interrupt processing.

   The following table details the offset of each register within the
console device's mapped memory:

`offset 0x00'
     Keyboard 1 Control

`offset 0x04'
     Keyboard 1 Data

`offset 0x08'
     Display 1 Control

`offset 0x0c'
     Display 1 Data

`offset 0x10'
     Keyboard 2 Control

`offset 0x14'
     Keyboard 2 Data

`offset 0x18'
     Display 2 Control

`offset 0x1c'
     Display 2 Data

`offset 0x20'
     Clock Control

   Within each control register, Bit 2 of each word is the Device
Interrupt Enable bit, and bit 1 is the Device Ready bit.  Only the
Device Interrupt Enable bits of the control registers are writable;
other bits must be written as zero. Only Device Interrupt Enable and
Device Ready are readable; other bits read as zero.

   Within each data register, writes are allowed only to the
least-significant 8 bits; the other 24 bits read as zero and must be
written as zero.

Interrupts
----------

   With a SPIM-compatible Console Device configured, the following
interrupt lines are enabled.

     Interrupt line 2 (Cause bit 0x0400) is wired to the Clock
     Interrupt line 3 (Cause bit 0x0800) is wired to the #1 Keyboard
     Interrupt line 4 (Cause bit 0x1000) is wired to the #1 Display
     Interrupt line 5 (Cause bit 0x2000) is wired to the #2 Keyboard
     Interrupt line 6 (Cause bit 0x4000) is wired to the #2 Display

   When any of the console devices becomes ready while its Device
Interrupt Enable bit is set, it also sets the appropriate bits in the
Cause register of CP0 and signals an Interrupt exception.

Display
-------

   The display data register is write-only.  On a write to the data
register, the display becomes unready and writes a char to the
connected serial interface; it becomes ready again in 40 ms.

Clock
-----

   The Clock has no data register and becomes ready at most every
second. A read from the Clock Control register makes the clock unready.
Writes to the clock control register are as above.

Keyboard
--------

   The keyboard is initially unready; whenever the connected serial
interface has a char waiting on input, and the keyboard is unready, the
keyboard reads the char into its buffer, and becomes ready. If the
keyboard is ready for more than 40 ms., it will check the connected
serial interface again.  If there is another char available, it will
read it and save it in the buffer, writing over the one which was
originally in the buffer. No provision is made for detection of these
buffer overruns.  Updates to the keyboard buffer happen at most once
per instruction fetched.

   The keyboard data register is read-only.  On a read from the data
register, if the keyboard is ready it becomes unready and returns the
byte in its holding buffer. If the keyboard data register is read while
the keyboard is unready, the data in the buffer is the same as when the
keyboard was last ready.

Standard clock device
=====================

   This section documents the standard clock device for VMIPS.  It is
intended to support user programs' access to real time, for the benefit
of realistic user perceptions, and simulated time, for repeatability of
experiments. It also supports a hardware clock interrupt, and provides
access to TOY (i.e., Time of Year) for those special occasions when you
want the clock to tell you what time it is, not just how fast things
are going.

   The reason this clock is to be preferred over the SPIM-compatible
console device's clock is because it provides much better resolution (1
MHz vs. 1 Hz).

Memory-mapped registers
-----------------------

   The standard clock device  has 5 registers, configured by default to
be mapped into memory at address 0xa1010000. The following table defines
the layout of the memory-mapped clock device registers:

`offset 0x00'
     real time, seconds

`offset 0x04'
     real time, microseconds

`offset 0x08'
     simulated time, seconds

`offset 0x0c'
     simulated time, microseconds

`offset 0x10'
     control word

   Writing any of the clock's time words is undefined.  Support for
setting the time from a MIPS program may be added in the future.

   The control word  has 32 bits.  The least-significant bit, when set
(`CDC_INTERRUPTS_ENABLED' is defined as 0x00000001), enables the clock
interrupt. All other bits of the control word are currently reserved
and read as zero.  Writing any of the other bits of the control word is
undefined.

Interrupts
----------

   The standard clock device is connected to hardware interrupt line 7
in the default configuration.

   The `clockintr' option gives the frequency of clock interrupts, in
nanoseconds of simulated time.  (See the "Summary of configuration
options" section of the "Customizing" chapter for more information.)
When a clock interrupt is triggered, it will be deasserted during the
following instruction.

Real vs. simulated time
-----------------------

   Real time is obtained using the host's `gettimeofday(2)' system
call, so it should run pretty close to whatever the host thinks the
current time is.  No sophisticated algorithms are used to calibrate the
real time clock, though.

   The speed of simulated time is determined by the `realtime',
`clockspeed', and `timeratio' options. (See the "Summary of
configuration options" section of the "Customizing" chapter for more
information.)  Increasing the speed of simulated time is unlikely to
make the simulator appreciably faster.

Extending
*********

   This chapter is intended to be a hacker's guide to adding or
modifying VMIPS functionality.

Road map to the VMIPS source code
=================================

   This section is intended to help interested persons find various
things in the VMIPS source code, and get a general idea of how the
various software modules are structured.

   The processing of command-line options and of options in your
`.vmipsrc' is directed by routines in `options.cc' and in class
`Options'. The default options and the option documentation is all in
`optiontbl.h'.

   The memory mapping unit has a high-level interface to the rest of
the code, which is defined in `mapper.cc' and `mapper.h', and in class
`Mapper'.  The memory mapping unit uses a bunch of low-level data
structures, which are defined in `range.cc' and `range.h', in classes
`Range' and `ProxyRange'. This is meant to be logically and physically
separate from the TLB, which is implemented as part of the system
control coprocessor.

   The system control coprocessor (MIPS coprocessor zero) and the TLB
are implemented in `cpzero.cc' and `cpzero.h', as class `CPZero'.

   There is a cache implementation in `cache.cc' and `cacheline.cc'
(classes `Cache' and `CacheLine'), but these modules are not finished
yet.

   The CPU (class `CPU') and the default exception handling behavior are
implemented in `cpu.cc' and `cpu.h'. Exception handling behavior is an
interface described by class DeviceExc (in `deviceexc.h'); the only
really important feature of this class right now is the `exception'
instance method and its implementation in class `CPU'.

   The disassembler, which uses GNU libopcodes (part of GNU Binutils),
is in `stub-dis.cc'.

   The SPIM-compatible console device, which is comprised of two serial
line TTYs and a clock, is in `spimconsole.cc' and `spimconsole.h'.

   The standard clock device is in `clockdev.cc' and `clockdev.h'.

   `zschip.cc' contains an unfinished emulation of the Zilog Z85C30
serial chip, commonly found in Macintoshes and Suns.

   The GNU debugger interface is separated into a high-level part (which
deals with the various debugger requests) in `debug.cc' and `debug.h',
and a low-level part (which assembles and disassembles the GDB remote
serial protocol packets), in `remotegdb.cc' and `remotegdb.h'.

   Many parts of the VMIPS system have a central procedure which needs
to be run periodically in a loop in order to update the part of the
simulation that they are responsible for.  Any part of the VMIPS system
which needs to be called back periodically to update its state can
inherit from class `Periodic' (described in `periodic.h') and implement
the `periodic()' member function.  The `CPU' class, for example,
fetches, decodes, and executes one instruction each time its
`periodic()' function is called.  Devices, such as the SPIM-compatible
console device, use their `periodic()' function check for and complete
pending I/O and trigger interrupts as necessary.

   The `vmips' class, implemented in `vmips.cc', is used to tie all the
components of the system together.  This class, and specifically its
`run()' member function, is responsible for setting up and configuring
all system components and calling the `periodic()' member function(s).
The vmips class is not a very smart or a very flexible configuration
mechanism; it will eventually be replaced with a configuration language
of some sort.

   The ROM bootstrap loader code (also known as the ROM monitor) is in
the directory `sample_code/xmboot'.  The current ROM monitor uses the
XMODEM protocol.

   The manual, and any random bits of hacking information which have not
yet been incorporated into the manual, are in the directory `doc'.

   A bunch of interesting test cases are in the directory `test_code'.
Most of the interesting sample code is being moved into the directory
`sample_code', but some interesting sample code continues to be stored
in the `test_code' directory.

   Various scripts used by the maintainers to help maintain the code are
in the directory `utils'.

Endianness issues
=================

   There are no known bugs involving endianness issues.

   However, when you are making extensions to VMIPS, it is important
not to assume that your host processor is little-endian (or to assume
that it is big-endian). The configuration procedure determines the
endianness of the VMIPS target and of the host processor, and will
define the C preprocessor symbol `BYTESWAPPED' if the two are
different. You can then call the `swap_word()' or `swap_halfword()'
static methods of class `Mapper' to do the translation between host and
target, when necessary.

   As you might expect, this is most important when dealing with
reading from memory or from memory-mapped devices.

   Most endianness problems can be dealt with using the `BYTESWAPPED'
symbol, except those problems originating in third-party libraries which
you might hook up to VMIPS. If you are calling external code that has to
know whether to expect big-endian or little-endian instructions or data,
or whether the host processor is big-endian or little-endian, you can
use the C preprocessor symbols `TARGET_LITTLE_ENDIAN' and
`TARGET_BIG_ENDIAN' for the target, and testing for the presence or
absence of the definition of `WORDS_BIGENDIAN' for the host.

Memory-Mapped Devices
=====================

   Memory-mapped devices must inherit from class `DeviceMap'.  They
must have a constructor and a destructor, and override the following
abstract methods:

     uint32 fetch_word(uint32 offset, int mode, DeviceExc *client);
     uint16 fetch_halfword(uint32 offset, DeviceExc *client);
     uint8 fetch_byte(uint32 offset, DeviceExc *client);
     uint32 store_word(uint32 offset, uint32 data, DeviceExc *client);
     uint16 store_halfword(uint32 offset, uint16 data, DeviceExc *client);
     uint8 store_byte(uint32 offset, uint8 data, DeviceExc *client);

   The meanings of the parameters are as follows:

OFFSET
     Byte offset from the beginning of the device's memory-mapped
     region that is being read or written. The width of the read
     (fetch) or write (store) is either a word (4 bytes), halfword (2
     bytes), or a single byte, depending on the call. Since this value
     is a byte offset, if you want to figure out which word of your
     device is being accessed, you should divide it by 4.

MODE
     This tells you whether the memory access is a data load
     (`DATALOAD'), data store (`DATASTORE'), or instruction fetch
     (`INSTFETCH'). These constants are defined in `accesstypes.h'. For
     narrow (< 1 word) fetches, the mode is always `DATALOAD'. For
     stores, the mode is always `DATASTORE'.  The only case in which
     this is ambiguous is for the `fetch_word' case, where mode may be
     either `DATALOAD' or `INSTFETCH'.  Most devices do not need to
     bother with the mode, except when there is an illegal access. See
     the section on exception behavior, below.

CLIENT
     Every memory access is requested by a client, which is responsible
     for handling any exceptions which may arise. Any component of the
     VMIPS system which may access memory must either inherit from
     class `DeviceExc' (i.e., "a device which may handle exceptions"),
     or have a pointer to a device which does. See the section on
     exception behavior, below.

DATA
     When the client is storing a value, you will receive the value as
     the DATA parameter.

Exception behavior
==================

   Whenever there is an exception, the device must make the call
     client->exception(type, mode);

   TYPE must be one of the standard MIPS exception codes, which are
defined in `regnames.h', and elsewhere in this manual. MODE is the mode
of the memory access; see the table entry for MODE above.

   Please note that you should not call the `exception' method in order
to generate a hardware interrupt (i.e., the Interrupt exception).
Interrupts are managed by class `IntCtrl', and your device should call
the `assertInt' function to generate them.  See the
"Interrupt-generating devices" section for more details on what you
should do.

Coprocessors
------------

   If your device is part of a MIPS coprocessor, you should pass a third
argument to the `client->exception()' call, which is the number of the
coprocessor; it may meaningfully be 0, 1, 2, or 3. Ordinarily, that is
to say in situations not involving coprocessors, this parameter
defaults to -1 and does not need to be specified explicitly.

   Coprocessor 0 is the MIPS system control coprocessor, responsible for
TLB and paging management. It is implemented as class `CPZero' in
`cpzero.cc' and `cpzero.h'. It has 16 registers, each of which has some
read-only bits and some read/write bits. Extension code should not
attempt to misrepresent itself as being coprocessor zero without a good
reason.

   One of the jobs of the `CPZero' class is to ensure that attempts to
write to these registers are only allowed to write to the bits which
are writable, so if you are interested in implementing read-only  and
read/write registers in your virtual hardware, look through `cpzero.cc'
for READ_MASKS and WRITE_MASKS.

   Coprocessor 1 is the floating point coprocessor, but it is not
implemented. It may, however, be implemented in the future. Volunteers
to begin such a task would be more than welcome.

   The default behavior of MIPS coprocessors 1, 2, and 3 in the VMIPS
system is to assume that they are not connected to the system and that
accesses to them should therefore trigger the `CpU' (Coprocessor
Unusable) exception.

Mapping memory-mapped devices
=============================

   You can map memory-mapped devices at one location, or more than one
location, if you want.  The instantiation process is as follows. Assume
that `TestDev' is a memory-mapped device class which derives from class
`DeviceMap', that TESTDEV is an instance of class `TestDev', and that
PHYSMEM is a `Mapper' (memory manager) object.

      	/* Test device at base phys addr 0x01000000 */
      	testdev = new TestDev();
      	physmem->add_device_mapping(testdev, 0x01000000);

   Therefore, if you want to have multiple base-addresses for a device,
you can. You can add as many calls to the Mapper instance method
`add_device_mapping(device, addr)' as you want. DEVICE is an instance
of a class deriving from class `DeviceMap'. ADDR is the physical
address where you want the device to appear in memory.

   This code is generally executed as part of the `vmips->run()' method
in `vmips.cc'. Look there for more information and some examples of
what to do.

Interrupt-generating devices
============================

   VMIPS provides support for virtual devices that generate hardware
interrupts to communicate with the processor. These virtual devices
should inherit from class `DeviceInt' (defined in `deviceint.h'). This
section outlines some information about how to write such virtual
devices.

Connecting devices to the interrupt controller
----------------------------------------------

   There are 8 interrupt lines in the R3000/R3000A, 6 of which (7..2)
are hardware interrupts (readable by software), and the other 2 of which
(1..0) are software interrupts (readable/writable by software).

   The class `IntCtrl' instance method `connectLine(irq, device)' is
used in `vmips.cc' to notify the interrupt controller and the device
that the interrupt line specified by IRQ is connected to DEVICE.  IRQ
must be one of the hardware interrupt constants defined in
`deviceint.h' and DEVICE must be an object of a class deriving from
`DeviceInt'.

Generating and cancelling interrupt requests
--------------------------------------------

   The class DeviceInt instance method `assertInt(irq)' is used to
request an interrupt from the processor.  Your device should only
request interrupts that have previously been connected to it using the
interrupt controller (see above). Your device may share an interrupt
request line with another device.  In practical terms, asserting an
interrupt request line will cause a trap to the general exception
vector before the next instruction.

   The instance method `deassertInt(irq)' will turn off the interrupt
request for your device; this should be done when the condition that
caused the device to request an interrupt has become satisfied. Note
that this does not necessarily imply that the interrupt request for the
processor will be turned off, as there may be another device trying to
use that interrupt request line.

   For both calls, the IRQ parameter must be one of the hardware
interrupt constants defined in `deviceint.h'.  It is not a good idea to
use the general `exception()' method to cause interrupt exceptions,
because this could cause excess interrupts to be generated.

   The place where you should make these calls and do these checks is
when your device's code is called through the `periodic()' callback.
Your device will get `periodic()' calls fairly often.

Software interrupts vs. hardware interrupts
-------------------------------------------

   Two of the interrupt lines (IRQ 0 and 1) are reserved for software
use. Only the interrupts which are not reserved for software use (IRQ 2
through 7) may be triggered by VMIPS devices.

Turning interrupts off and on
-----------------------------

   There is a global Interrupt Enable bit for the whole system; this is
the IEc (Interrupt Enable (current)) bit, bit 0 (mask 0x001) of the
Status register (coprocessor zero register 12).  If this bit is turned
off, no interrupt will be triggered. Be sure to turn on your Interrupt
Enable and Interrupt Mask (below) bits when you are testing your new
interrupt-generating device.

   Additionally, bits 15 - 8 (mask 0x0ff00) of the Status register are
individual Interrupt Mask bits. Each bit represents a global interrupt
enable/disable bit for the entire system per interrupt-request line. For
example, if you turn off bit 10 of this register (mask 0x0400), the IRQ2
line will be disabled for the whole system.

   Finally, it is not uncommon for individual devices to have their own
interrupt enable/disable bits that you can set or clear. See the
documentation for each individual device for more information.

Weird things
============

Branch on Coprocessor Zero True/False
-------------------------------------

   These instructions are not supposed to cause reserved instruction
exceptions, even though the behavior of BC0F and BC0T instructions on
MIPS-1 machines is not specified in most canonical references.

   On some DEC MIPS machines, the coprocessor 0 condition bit (which
BC0F and BC0T test) is wired to the external write-buffer-empty bit;
that is, when all stores have completed, the write buffer becomes
empty, and the bit goes to true. This makes it possible for a hacker to
write the line `1: bc0f 1b' and thereby loop until the write buffer is
empty.  However, this is not true of all DECstations, or of the Sony
NEWS 3400.

   The coprocessor zero condition bit has an entirely different use on
the R4400 and compatible processors; it is used to tell when you got a
cache hit with a CACHE operation. The R10000 also implements this
condition, but the bit is not wired to the coprocessor zero condition.

   Since VMIPS does not support CACHE operations, and does not have a
write buffer, VMIPS emulates the case where the CpCond bit for CP0 is
always TRUE, i.e., applications that look for the writebuffer will find
that it is always empty.

Installation
************

   The VMIPS build process assumes that you have a full set of GNU MIPS
cross compilation tools installed, because you'll need them to do
anything useful with VMIPS. For a concise summary of how to build the
necessary MIPS cross tools, read "Building MIPS Cross Tools", below.

   VMIPS uses the GNU Autoconf/Automake system for configuration
management.  This provides the familiar `configure' shell script
interface for setting configuration variables. For more information
about the special options that VMIPS `configure' accepts, read on, or
give the `--help' option to `configure' for an abridged version.

Building from CVS
=================

   If you retrieved your sources from the CVS repository, you will need
Automake version 1.4 or later, Autoconf version 2.13 or later, and
libtool 1.2f or later. You will need perl 5 to build the documentation.
Your distribution will be missing many important files, including
`configure'. To generate these, run `utils/bootstrap'. To automatically
run configure once it has been generated, you can run `utils/bootstrap
-c CONFIGURE-ARGS'.

Options that configure supports
===============================

   You will need to tell `configure' the configuration prefix you used
to install the MIPS cross tools, by specifying it as the value to the
`--with-mips' argument. For example, if your MIPS cross compiler is
`/opt/mips/bin/mips-dec-ultrix4.3-gcc' and your MIPS-targeted
libopcodes libtool library (which should have been installed by the
binutils Makefile) is `/opt/mips/lib/libopcodes.la', then you should
specify `--with-mips=/opt/mips' on the `configure' command line.

   Other options that "configure" supports are as follows:

`--with-mips=MDIR'
     Specify installation prefix of MIPS cross tools (default MDIR =
     /opt/mips).

`--with-mips-lib=DIR'
     Specify path to MIPS cross tools' libraries (default MDIR/lib).

`--with-mips-bin=DIR'
     Specify path to MIPS cross tools' executables (default MDIR/bin).

`--with-mips-include=DIR'
     Specify path to MIPS cross tools' includes (default MDIR/include).

`--with-mips-bfdtarget=TARG'
     Specify MIPS cross tools BFD target name (defaults to the first
     target listed in the output of objdump -i). Normally you can let
     configure guess this, unless you built your MIPS tools for a
     target (mips-ecoff or mips-elf, for example) which supports both
     big-endian and little-endian data.

`--with-mips-endianness=VAL'
     Specify endianness of the VMIPS simulated machine, which must
     match the MIPS cross tools target's endianness.  VAL may be
     specified as `big' or `little'.  It is best to let configure guess
     this (using objdump -i), unless you have reason to believe it is
     guessing wrong, because if you get it wrong, vmipstool may compile
     ROMs that do not run correctly under vmips.

`--disable-debug'
     Strip debugging symbols and turn on all the compiler optimizations.
     The default is not to do this (i.e., leave in the debugging
     symbols, and turn off all the compiler optimizations.)

`--disable-tty'
     Do not include (default=include) support for the emulated serial
     interface.

Building MIPS Cross Tools
=========================

   First decide on an installation prefix. The following examples will
use the prefix "/opt/mips", as above.

   Download a copy of Binutils, from any GNU mirror, or from the URL:
     <ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/binutils/releases>
   We recommend getting version 2.10.1. The file you will need would be
named `binutils-2.10.1.tar.gz'.

   Build binutils by running the following commands. We recommend
`--disable-nls' because some recent versions do not build correctly with
NLS (linking against `libopcodes.a' results in unresolved symbols.)

     ./configure --target=mips-dec-ultrix4.3 --prefix=/opt/mips \
      --disable-nls --enable-shared
     make
     make install

   Save a copy of `include/dis-asm.h' from the Binutils source
distribution.  You'll need to install it as `include/dis-asm.h' in the
VMIPS source distribution, in order to ensure compatibility between the
version of Binutils you used and VMIPS.

   Download a copy of the GNU Compiler Collection (`gcc') from any GNU
mirror, or from the URL:
     <ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/releases>
   We recommend version 2.95.2. Download the file `gcc-2.95.2.tar.gz'.

   You can read the documentation for building the compiler by pointing
your World-Wide Web browser at <http://gcc.gnu.org/install>.  When you
encounter difficulties, you should consider consulting the
documentation for building the compiler, because it is more complete
than the following summary.

  1. Unpack the sources. Let's say you unpack them in `/usr/build',
     creating the directory `/usr/build/gcc-2.95.2'.

  2. Create the build directory `/usr/build/gcc-mips-build'.

  3. First, add the directory `/opt/mips/bin' (where you just installed
     Binutils) to your path, so that the compiler configuration process
     can find your MIPS-targetted assembler and linker.

  4. Configure the compiler. Change to the directory
     `/usr/build/gcc-mips-build' and issue the following command. (The
     back-slash characters represent the usual Unix shell convention of
     continuing a command on the following line, and are inserted for
     typesetting purposes.)

          ../gcc-2.95.2/configure --target=mips-dec-ultrix4.3 \
           --prefix=/opt/mips --with-gnu-as --with-gnu-ld \
           --disable-threads --disable-shared

  5. If the configuration step fails, make sure you have a working
     native compiler, and/or try a different version of gcc. Otherwise,
     proceed to compile the compiler:

          make -k MAKE='make -k TARGET_LIBGCC2_CFLAGS=-Dinhibit_libc' cross
          make -k LANGUAGES=c install

     The reason `make -k' is required is because some parts of the gcc
     toolkit may fail to build, but the compiler itself may be OK.

     The `-Dinhibit_libc' option is required when you are building the
     compiler in the absence of a MIPS C library, as is often the case
     with VMIPS users.

     Do not be alarmed by errors in building or installing the compiler;
     the cross compiler install interface is less than polished.

  6. You should be able to use the newly-installed  compiler to compile
     (but not link) a program that does not use any C library functions.
     If this works, you should be able to use the cross tools you have
     just built for VMIPS.

     If you want to build a MIPS C library, you can also do that now,
     but it is not strictly required for many useful VMIPS tasks. Some
     persons have reported success using the "newlib" C library from
     Cygnus. The GNU C Library (glibc) is fairly difficult to build.
     Instructions for building a C library will appear here soon.

Future Directions
*****************

Version 1.1 targets
===================

Caches
------

   The caches are not currently finished, and not connected to the rest
of the memory subsystem.

   Arguments in favor of finishing the caches include the fact that
operating systems tend to expect them, and you can learn some things
about how many cache misses your code incurs if you simulate them.
Arguments in favor of ditching the caches center around the performance
penalty that simulating them would cause.

   Finishing the implementation of the cache is a two-part task:
  1. Implement cache "store partial" mode.

  2. Implement the non-"store partial" mode; i.e., where a store causes
     the cache line to be invalidated unconditionally. (pp. 5-5 & 5-6
     in MIPS RISC Architecture).
        Understanding how to do this is probably best accomplished by
first reading `cache.cc' and `mapper.cc'.

Cache behavior and the Status register
......................................

   CP0 implements two Diagnostic Status bits in the Status register
called IsC and SwC; they can be used by the OS to determine the cache
geometry exactly, for example. These can be tested by the appropriate
accessor functions in cpzero.cc.

   Cache isolation (IsC = 1) means the cache is never refilled and all
accesses are considered hits; stores write into the cache and do not
write into memory.

   Cache swapping (SwC = 1) means the instruction cache and data cache
are switched, so that instruction fetches go through the data cache and
load/store instructions go through the instruction cache.

Other version 1.1 targets
-------------------------

  1. Make the SPIM console device more efficient. Currently the code
     spends 36% of its time in calls to `select()' and 35% in all the
     emulation functions, which is unacceptably slow. Probably we will
     want to use a separate thread to cause interrupts instead of
     polling. We'll likely have to restructure the interrupt controller
     for this.
        * A thought I had was to use a separate thread for everyone who
          wants to have `periodic()' called.

        * Michael Constant suggesting using `FIOASYNC', `sigaction()'
          with `SA_SIGINFO', and handling `SIGPOLL' by dispatching to
          the correct interrupt generator.  This would be both more
          portable and easier to understand than threads.

  2. Make the build process suck less. Right now it requires drawing a
     pentagram around your computer on the night of a full moon with
     torches blazing, not to mention a very close synchronization
     between versions of gcc, binutils, gdb, and whatever else you are
     trying to use. It may be a good idea to build a "combined source
     tree" including gcc, vmips, gdb, and binutils source together for
     people to install.

  3. Generally make things faster. Some other strategies for making
     things faster:

  4. The way we do options must die. Replace it with
        * a bunch of global (or instance-variable-local) variables, to
          replace class Options, and

        * a real configuration language (to replace `.vmipsrc').
          Probably Tcl or Guile Scheme will be used. Tcl is attractive
          because it is well-integrated with the Cygnus combined source
          trees.  Guile Scheme is attractive because it is the official
          GNU language for extension.

  5. The console device stuff, above.

  6. Galen's dynamic recompilation stuff, or a suitable replacement
     using GNU Lightning.

  7. We need to have a benchmark suite in place in order to quantify
     all this.

  8. Some of the data structures could use some improvement:
        * memory mapping range list

        * maybe tlb

  9. Write a testing framework. DejaGNU would be the place to begin.


Version 1.5 targets
===================

  1. When configuring a serial device, the user should be able to
     select a machine-dependent serial front-end (e.g., unix-xterm,
     posix-serial, mac-serial, mac-ttywidget, etc.) and a
     machine-independent serial back-end (zilog-z85c30, spim-console,
     etc.) These would be good to implement using shared libs. Also,
     modularizing the CPU, memory mapper and other pieces (freezing
     APIs, building as shlibs) would be a Very Good Thing Indeed. (In
     general, we need to throw out vmips.cc and replace it with a smart
     configuration mechanism, probably based on Guile Scheme or Tcl.)

  2. Ideally, debugger should be able to be attached at any time,
     without the user having had to think of it. Delay the debugging
     interface initialization until a connection is received?

  3. NLS (i.e., i18n).  This will require some un-American activities.


Version 2.0 targets
===================

  1. One thing VMIPS could really use is an emulation of the MIPS R3010
     FPU.  A good way to get started on building an FPU would be to use
     SoftFloat:
     <http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jhauser/arithmetic/softfloat.html>.


Other things to do
==================

   Future directions which are not associated with any particular
release target:

  1. For the ROM monitor, support TFTP (UDP) over SLIP with some fixed
     kernel name and a configurable address (but probably not ARP).

  2. For the `ZSChip' module, finish the emulation, and validate it
     against some stable free-software serial drivers.

  3. For the debugging interface, support more and more different GDB
     remote serial protocol packets. It would have been nice, for
     example, to use the remote Z-packet interface for breakpoints.

  4. Full MIPS32 support.

  5. Checkpoint and restart of simulations.

  6. Develop a patch for gas to support software register names.  gas
     supports $sp and $gp but not, say, $t0.

  7. Consolidate some of the .h files that just contain huge lists of
     useful constants.

     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed
     to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not
     Transparent.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
     Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
     or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than
     100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you
     must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly,
     all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
     computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
     of the Document, free of added material, which the general
     network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
     charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has less than five).

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and
          add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgments" or "Dedications",
          preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all
          the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgments and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to
          conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled
     "Acknowledgments", and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a
     Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation
     copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is
     called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
     other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on
     account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
     derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one
     quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be
     placed on covers that surround only the Document within the
     aggregate.  Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole
     aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License provided that you also include the
     original English version of this License.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original English
     version of this License, the original English version will prevail.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
----------------------------------------------------

   To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
       Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
       A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no Front-Cover
Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of "Front-Cover Texts being
LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
