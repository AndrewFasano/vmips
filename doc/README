Notes on cross-compiling glibc
------------------------------

 using egcs-1.0.3a with sgi patches, binutils 2.10, glibc 2.1.92 does
 pretty well: it fails with assertion failures in ld.

 using gcc-2.95.2, binutils 2.10, glibc 2.1.92 generates
 this: ../sysdeps/mips/setjmp.S:43: Error: Can not represent
 BFD_RELOC_16_PCREL_S2 relocation in this object file format

 best so far was egcs-1.0.3a with sgi patches, binutils 000827, glibc
 2.1.92 it fails in linuxthreads -- it is not seeing __attribute((weak)) on
 __pthread_initialize_minimal in libc-start and soinit, and so anything
 that links against libc.so.6 fails w/ an undefined reference to that
 symbol.

 this looks pretty promising:

 (amazing. you mean it's easier to port a library when you have something
 to run it on? :-)
