Things yet to be done
---------------------

Version 1.0 was released 27 Oct 2001.
Version 1.1 will be the next feature release.

For the future enhancements that used to be here, see the "Future Directions"
section of the manual.

Notes on cross-compiling glibc
------------------------------

 using egcs-1.0.3a with sgi patches, binutils 2.10, glibc 2.1.92 does
 pretty well: it fails with assertion failures in ld.

 using gcc-2.95.2, binutils 2.10, glibc 2.1.92 generates
 this: ../sysdeps/mips/setjmp.S:43: Error: Can not represent
 BFD_RELOC_16_PCREL_S2 relocation in this object file format

 best so far was egcs-1.0.3a with sgi patches, binutils 000827, glibc
 2.1.92 it fails in linuxthreads -- it is not seeing __attribute((weak)) on
 __pthread_initialize_minimal in libc-start and soinit, and so anything
 that links against libc.so.6 fails w/ an undefined reference to that
 symbol.

 this looks pretty promising:

 (amazing. you mean it's easier to port a library when you have something
 to run it on? :-)
