Things yet to be done
---------------------

Version 1.0 blockers:

 /* Incorporate instructions for compiling glibc. There should be an
  * answer to this for at least one version of glibc, even if the answer sucks.
  *
  * Apparently they still haven't gotten their heads out of their asses yet.
  * I guess this will have to wait for after 1.0.
  */

 /* Get a good sense of how hard it is to build vmips on various platforms.
  * Create and populate a build status webpage with pointers to hints.
  *
  * The build status webpage exists.
  * This will be fleshed out as people start messing with it *after* 1.0
  * is released.
  */

 /* Decide how fast interrupts should *really* go in -o realtime mode
  * (see doc/realtime for more info)
  * Document final version of clockdev.
  * Test final version of clockdev.
  *  - Might need to make sure it still works w/ big-endian
  * DONE
  */

 /* Also add licenses to manual
  * DONE
  */

section of the manual.
