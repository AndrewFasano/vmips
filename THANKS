 Conversations I had with Michael Constant <mconst@csua.berkeley.edu>
 provided me with the initial impetus for writing the emulator.
 My experience in Computer Science 61C at UC Berkeley helped to reinforce
 my convictions in the matter. ;-)

 I looked to James Larus's SPIM simulator for examples of what to do
 (and sometimes, what not to do) when faced with certain tricky issues.

 Galen Hancock <galen@csua.berkeley.edu> has provided some patches.

 Paul Twohey <twohey@csua.berkeley.edu> has provided some patches,
 and has generously tested new versions of VMIPS as they are released,
 on various architectures.
